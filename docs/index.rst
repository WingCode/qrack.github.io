Welcome to vm6502q's documentation!

Let's hear it for some math!

..math:: e^(i\pi) + 1 = 0
   :label: pmatrix

Hm!

..math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{pmatrix}
   \alpha& \beta^{*}\\
   \gamma^{*}& \delta
   \end{pmatrix}

   :label: pmatrix
   :caption: An example matrix.

That's a pretty nifty matrix at :eq:`pmatrix`!

Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
