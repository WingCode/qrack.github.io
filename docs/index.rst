Welcome to vm6502q's documentation!

Let's hear it for some math!

.. math:: e^(i\pi) + 1 = 0
   :label: pmatrix1

Hm!

.. math::
   :label: pmatrix2

   \begin{pmatrix}
   \alpha& \beta^{*}\\
   \gamma^{*}& \delta
   \end{pmatrix}


That's a pretty nifty matrix at :eq:`pmatrix2`!

Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
